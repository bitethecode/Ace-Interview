# Ace-Interview

![Logo](/dsa.jpeg)

Hi, folks! <br/>
I know many of you have struggled to wrap your head around data structure and algorithms to prepare for your next technical interviews and it is stressful, indeed! 
Plus, you may experience the knowledge you tried to push into your brain fade away after a few weeks. At least, that was me :)
<br/>

I realize that we can prepare these and pass the interviews successfully with the right system and strategies from the experience. <br/>
Thus, I'm trying to compile all the knowledge/resources you need along with the system I devised. Wish this boosts your learning journey of this :wink:
